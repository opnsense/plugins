Port Forward REST API plugin for OPNsense

This plugin exposes NAT port forwarding rules via a REST API, enabling external
tools to manage port forwards programmatically. It provides full CRUD operations
(list, add, delete, toggle) for port forward rules and automatically manages the
associated firewall filter rules.

Features:
- List all port forward rules
- Add new port forward rules with automatic filter rule creation
- Delete port forward rules with automatic filter rule cleanup
- Enable/disable rules without deleting them
- Changes take effect immediately (auto-reload)

API Endpoints:
- GET  /api/portforwardapi/rules/list        - List all rules
- POST /api/portforwardapi/rules/add         - Create new rule
- POST /api/portforwardapi/rules/del/{id}    - Delete rule by ID
- POST /api/portforwardapi/rules/toggle/{id} - Enable/disable rule
- GET  /api/portforwardapi/rules/status      - Get rule count
