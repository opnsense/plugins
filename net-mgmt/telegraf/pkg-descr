Telegraf is the Agent for Collecting & Reporting Metrics & Data.

metrics directly from the system itâ€™s running on, pull metrics
from third-party APIs, or even listen for metrics via a StatsD
and Kafka consumer services. It also has output plugins to send
metrics to a variety of other datastores, services, and message
queues, including InfluxDB, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Datadog, Librato,
