Configuration Sync is a tool designed to one-way synchronize the system 
configuration files from the OPNsense host to S3 compatible object data storage 
in close to real time.  While the tool has the effect of being a great 
configuration backup tool the intent is to provide a tool that stores the 
OPNsense system configuration in a location that is readily addressable using 
DevOps automation tools such as Terraform.
