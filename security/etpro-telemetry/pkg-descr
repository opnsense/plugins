Todays cybersecurity engineers need timely and accurate data about eminent threats and how they spread around the globe.
With this data cybersecurity researchers and analysts can improve the detection of malicious network traffic.
The times when we could rely on just firewall rules for our protection are long gone.
Additional layers of security are desperately needed to guard against these attacks.

With growing risks the need to fortify our security is growing for both big enterprises as for SMEs alike, but often
out of reach for the latter.
An important extra security addition is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS).

The IDS/IPS available in OPNsense is based on Suricata.
This open source IDS/IPS engine has proven its value in OPNsense, especially in combination with the free Proofpoint ETOpen ruleset.

The need for valuable threat detection data and the increasing importance of additional network security
has brought Proofpoint and OPNsense together.
Our joined efforts resulted in the ETPro Telemetry edition.

The ETPro Telemetry edition embraces our vision that sharing knowledge leads to better products.

When you allow your OPNsense system to share anonymized information about detected threats - the alerts -
you are able to use the ETPro ruleset free of charge.
