        <help>Start stunnel in it a chroot, although this is a more secure option there are small points of attention before
          using this. Since system logging is detached after startup, stunnel seems to have difficulties handing syslog configuration changes
          which need a service restart. If this happens, you need to restart stunnel manually as well.

        <help>Enable internal ident service (rfc1413), which tracks authenticated tcp sessions and returns the associated user
          of the certificate used by stunnel (cn part). When enabled, this service listens on port tcp/113 and accepts port pairs as defined by rfc1413.
          Make sure you deny untrusted clients access to this facility, usually it only makes sense to allow access from this
          firewall (allowed by default).
