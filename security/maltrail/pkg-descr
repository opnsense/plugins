Maltrail is a malicious traffic detection system, utilizing publicly
available (black)lists containing malicious and/or generally suspicious
trails, along with static trails compiled from various AV reports and
custom user defined lists, where trail can be anything from domain name,
URL, IP address or HTTP User-Agent header value. Also, it uses advanced
heuristic mechanisms that can help in discovery of unknown threats.
