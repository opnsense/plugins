OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support
Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN. It has since been ported to support
the Juniper SSL VPN which is now known as Pulse Connect Secure.

OpenConnect is released under the GNU Lesser Public License, version 2.1.

Like vpnc, OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated
in any way with, Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks or Pulse Secure.
It just happens to interoperate with their equipment.
