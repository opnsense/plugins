#
# Before 22.1, OPNsense used circular logs under /var/log/*.log that
# can still be around. They are old, in binary format and are not needed by crowdsec.
#
# For this reason we don't scan /var/log/*.log, but some plugins can write
# their (plaintext) logs in that location, in such case add their pathnames too.
