#
# Before 22.1, OPNsense used circular logs under /var/log/*.log that
# can still be around. They are old, in binary format and are not needed by crowdsec.
#
# For this reason we don't scan /var/log/*.log, but some plugins can write
# their (plaintext) logs in that location, in such case add their pathnames too.
#

filenames:
  # DO NOT EDIT - to add new datasources (log locations),
  # create new files in /usr/local/etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/

  # collection: crowdsecurity/sshd

  # collection: crowdsecurity/opnsense-gui (web admin)
  - /var/log/lighttpd/latest.log
  # collection: firewallservices/pf
  - /var/log/filter/latest.log

# When OPNsense is configured with /var/log in a RAM disk,
# the log directories are created after crowdsec is run.
# We force crowdsec to watch over directory creation as well
# as file creation. FreeBSD has kqueue instead of inotify
# but the option works with both.
force_inotify: true

# this option is required from crowdsec v1.5.0 to follow
# changes in symlinks
