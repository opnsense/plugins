About the OPNsense plugins
==========================

The plugins collection offers users and developers a way to quickly
build additions for OPNsense that can be optionally installed.  As
soon as they are upstreamed they will become available to everyone
through the firmware GUI pages.

Plugins can do the following:

* Modify the menu, access control lists and look and feel (themes)
* Add additional server software and their respective GUI pages
* Create new authentication methods to be used within other subsystems
* Provide other types of devices and interfaces to the firewall
* Pull in additional packages that will update automatically
* Enhance the backend services with additional work tasks
* Allow custom start, stop and early scripts
* Persistent /boot/loader.conf modifications
* Additional themes for the web GUI

Now we need your help to enrich the plugins.  Feel free to contact us
at project AT opnsense DOT org or open GitHub issue to get in touch.


Stay safe,
Your OPNsense team

A brief description of how to use the plugins repository
========================================================

The workflow of the plugins repository is quite similar to the
core repository, although the plugins have one source directory
per plugin, while the core can be thought of a lone plugin.

Commits for individual plugins should therefore be split into
individual chunks for each src/ directory so that they can be
reviewed separately and also be applied remotely.

When an OPNsense release is built, the plugins are automatically
added to the final package repository.

The most useful Makefile targets and their purpose is described
below.

The make targets for the root directory:

* clean:	remove all changes and unknown files
* lint:		run syntax checks
* list:		print a list of all plugin directories with comments
* style-fix:	apply style fixes
* style:	run style checks
* sweep:	apply whitespace fixes

The make targets for any plugin directory:

* clean:	remove all changes and unknown files
* collect:	gather updates from target directory
* install:	install to target directory
* lint:		run syntax checks
* package:	creates a package
* upgrade:	upgrades existing package
* remove:	remove known files from target directory
* style-fix:	apply style fixes
* style:	run style checks
* sweep:	apply whitespace fixes
