WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN
that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be
faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while
avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be considerably
more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a
general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and
super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.
Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now
cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under
heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the
most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in
the industry.
