Manage the Quagga Routing Software Suite, which offers routing protocols
like RIP, IS-IS and OSPF to guide your packets through the sea.

This package sets up the quagga routing suite for your use and currently supports
only the routing protocol OSPF.

OSPF
====

An advanced link state protocol for IPv4 routing.
The routing decision is based on cost which can be defined or calculated.

RIP
===

A simple distance vector protocol which is often used because it is simple
to configure. The routing decision is based on the hop count.
RIP is currently not implemented in this plugin.
