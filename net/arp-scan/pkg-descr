ARP Scan sends ARP packets to hosts on the local network and displays
any responses that are received.

The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) uses a simple message format containing
one address resolution request or response (usually IPv4).

ARP Scan is a simple tool yet very powerful and it represent the only way
to find a device using an arp response. Once you’ve found the MAC
address, you can find more info about that device by matching that MAC
address to it’s vendor.

Arp scan techniques are very important to understand ARP/MAC responses
for penetration tester and diagnosys purpose. It is the first tool for
network monitoring, especially against ip collisions, arpspoof and all
kind of hijack techniques, like Man-In-The-Middle Attack. It also helps
in cases when someone is spoofing IP address and DoS-ing your server.
