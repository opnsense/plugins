vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux
and BSD that keeps a log of network traffic for the selected
interface(s). It uses the network interface statistics
provided by the kernel as information source. This means
that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also
ensures light use of system resources.
