# hints
#
#       The hints file.   This file is used to match
#       a request, and then add attributes to it.  This
#       process allows a user to login as "bob.ppp" (for example),
#       and receive a PPP connection, even if the NAS doesn't
#       ask for PPP.  The "hints" file is used to match the
#       ".ppp" portion of the username, and to add a set of
#       "user requested PPP" attributes to the request.
#
#       Matching can take place with the the Prefix and Suffix
#       attributes, just like in the "users" file.
#       These attributes operate ONLY on the username, though.
#
#       Note that the attributes that are set for each
#       entry are _NOT_ passed back to the terminal server.
#       Instead they are added to the information that has
#       been _SENT_ by the terminal server.
#
#       This extra information can be used in the users file to
#       match on. Usually this is done in the DEFAULT entries,
#       of which there can be more than one.
#
#       In addition a matching entry can transform a username
#       for authentication purposes if the "Strip-User-Name"
#       variable is set to Yes in an entry (default is Yes).
#
#       A special non-protocol name-value pair called "Hint"
#       can be set to match on in the "users" file.
#
#       The following is how most ISPs want to set this up.
