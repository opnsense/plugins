FreeRADIUS includes a RADIUS server, a BSD licensed client library, a
PAM library, and an Apache module. In most cases, the word FreeRADIUS
refers to the RADIUS server.

FreeRADIUS is the most widely deployed RADIUS server in the world. It
is the basis for multiple commercial offerings. It supplies the AAA
needs of many Fortune-500 companies and Tier 1 ISPs.

It is also widely used for Enterprise Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.1X network
security, particularly in the academic community, including eduroam.

The server is fast, feature-rich, modular, and scalable.
