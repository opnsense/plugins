FRRouting (FRR) is an IP routing protocol suite for Linux and Unix
platforms which includes protocol daemons for BGP, IS-IS, LDP, OSPF,
PIM, and RIP.

FRR's seamless integration with the native Linux/Unix IP networking stacks
makes it applicable to a wide variety of use cases including connecting
hosts/VMs/containers to the network, advertising network services, LAN
switching and routing, Internet access routers, and Internet peering.
