The ISC Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Distribution provides a
freely redistributable reference implementation of all aspects of the
DHCP protocol.

This plugin implements the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server in OPNsense, which
used to be the standard implementation of DHCP until better alternatives
such as Dnsmasq and Kea were supplied.
