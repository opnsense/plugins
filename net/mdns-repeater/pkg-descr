mdns-repeater is a Multicast DNS repeater. Multicast DNS uses the 224.0.0.251
address, which is "administratively scoped" and does not leave the subnet.

This program re-broadcast mDNS packets from one interface to other interfaces.
It can be used to bridge zeroconf devices to work properly across the two subnets.
