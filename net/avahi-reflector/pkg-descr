Avahi mDNS/DNS-SD Reflector

Runs avahi-daemon in reflector mode, proxying multicast DNS and
DNS Service Discovery traffic across VLANs. Unlike mdns-repeater,
Avahi handles full mDNS A/AAAA record queries and DNS-SD browsing,
enabling reliable hostname resolution and Bonjour service discovery
across network segments.
