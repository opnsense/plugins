Plugin Changelog
================

1.5.5

* Fix: "Apply" could hang when websockets are in use by clients. A grace period of 10s has been added in General Settings that forces to close all connections on config changes.
* Add: In Reverse Proxy, a new dropdown can select one or multiple domains, filtering the Bootgrids of Domains, Subdomains and Handlers for the selected Domain.
* Add: Global Log Level can be set in Log Settings.
* Fix: "Apply" will always read all certificates from the filesystem, even if the Caddy configuration has remained unchanged. "reload" has been changed to "reloadssl".

1.5.4

* Fix: When pressing Apply, the Caddy service will be reloaded instead of restarted. This fixes long restart times and service interruptions.
* Change: All Description Fields are now required to be populated.
* Change: Model Relation Fields now display two values instead of one to make most options appear unique.
* Add: HTTP response code and HTTP response message can be set per access list in advanced mode.
* Add: Header functionality added. Multiple header manipulations can be set per handler.
* Cleanup: Update searchBase() in ReverseProxyController.php for easier maintainability.
* Fix: Move selectpicker empty option to model in general.volt, using BlankDesc. This fixes the option IPv4+IPv6 not appearing in Dynamic DNS.
* Add: Simple Load Balancing support with the default random policy, by allowing to add multiple Upstream Domains in Handlers.
* Add: Passive Health check for load balancing (Upstream Fail Duration) in Handlers.
* Fix: Input validation so a base domain like "example.com" and a wildcard domain like "*.example.com" can now be created at the same time in domains.

1.5.3

* Change from "Phalcon Messages" to "OPNsense Messages" in Caddy.php.
* Change default storage location from /usr/local/etc/caddy to /var/db/caddy/data/caddy/.
* Change description from "TextField" to "DescriptionField" in Caddy.xml model.
* Add tls_insecure_skip_verify to handlers.
* Add possibility to restart Caddy with the ACME Client by using "Automations - Run Command - System or Plugin Command".
* Add option to redirect the ACME HTTP-01 challenge to an upstream destination as advanced option in domains.
* Remove unmaintained DNS Providers: dnspod, hetzner, namesilo, vercel, alidns, metaname, openstack-designate.
* Cleanup dialogs and UI to present all options better.

1.5.2

* Increased timeout of message area in reverse_proxy.volt and general.volt to 15 seconds.
* When pressing Apply, the form is saved automatically before the reconfigure action.
* Cleaned up Caddy.xml model to satisfy make lint.
* When selecting an interface in Dynamic DNS, at most one IPv6 GUA and IPv4 non-RFC1918 address will be extracted. Fixes all IP addresses being read.

1.5.1

* More DNS Providers added: netlify, namesilo, njalla, vercel, googleclouddns, alidns, powerdns, tencentcloud, dinahosting, metaname, hexonet, ddnss, linode, mailinabox, ovh, namecheap, azure, openstack-designate.
* More input fields and better documentation added for the DNS Provider API Keys.

* Updated dependancy to caddy-custom instead of caddy.
* Removed +POST_DEINSTALL.post and +POST_INSTALL.post.
* Turned syslog-ng configuration from template to static file.
* A few typos in the general.volt and reverse_proxy.volt corrected.
* The RealInterfaceField custom Fieldtype was removed and replaced with an OPNsense integrated template function to read the interface name.
* Enable $internalModelUseSafeDelete in ReverseProxyController.php - Items can only be deleted when they are not referenced by other items, making deleting in the GUI safer since there can't be any orphaned configuration left behind.
* Migration script M1_1_3 from "Description" to "description" added. Lower case description is needed to be in line with some OPNsense integrated functions.
