Plugin Changelog
================

1.5.7

* Build: Update to Caddy v2.8.4 + caddy-dns plugins updated to latest upstream versions
* Add: Error message when OPNsense WebGUI settings conflict with Auto HTTPS.
* Add: Error message when Auto HTTPS is enabled, and ACME email field is empty, for caddy v2.8.4
* Cleanup: Fix crash of searchAction when reverseUuids is null
* Cleanup: basicauth directive is now basic_auth in the Caddyfile template, for caddy v2.8.4
* Change: Dynamic DNS "TTL" and "Check Interval" have been changed to seconds. Existing values have been reset to use the defaults of the implementation.
* Add: Dynamic DNS now supports "Update Only", only updating existing records without creating new ones.
* Fix: The subdomain port field has been removed, since it is unsupported. Subdomains track their ports from their parent wildcard domain.
* Add: DNS Providers: dnsmadeeasy, bunny, civo, scaleway, acmeproxy, inwx, namedotcom, easydns, infomaniak, directadmin, hosttech, vultr
* Remove: DNS Providers: godaddy
* Cleanup: Refactor dns provider configuration in Caddyfile template

1.5.6

* Fix: Wildcard domains with activated "Dynamic DNS" update their base domain with * instead of @.
* Add: DNS Providers: Netcup, RFC2136

1.5.5

* Fix: "Apply" could hang when websockets are in use by clients. A grace period of 10s has been added in General Settings that forces to close all connections on config changes.
* Add: In Reverse Proxy, a new dropdown can select one or multiple domains, filtering the Bootgrids of Domains, Subdomains and Handlers for the selected Domain.
* Add: Global Log Level can be set in Log Settings.
* Fix: "Apply" will always read all certificates from the filesystem, even if the Caddy configuration has remained unchanged. "reload" has been changed to "reloadssl".
* Change: ACME Email should be filled out since it's a requirement for ZeroSSL.
* Fix: "Save" and "Apply" buttons in General Settings have been improved to reliably trigger validation of form.
* Cleanup: Javascript variables have been changed from var to let to reduce scope.
* Fix: Template has been fixed to allow any TLS option in Handlers to appear independant when filled out. This increases flexibility with the "tls_server_name" option.
* Add: Diagnostics view added where the current Caddyfile and JSON configuration can be displayed, validated and downloaded.
* Add: HTTP-01 Challenge Redirection can also be configured for subdomains.
* Cleanup: lang() and gettext() functions added for translations.
* Cleanup: Rewritten most help texts in forms for consistency.
* Fix: The newly introduced "configctl caddy reload" action, which calls the "service caddy reloadssl" command, will now also trigger the setup.sh script.

1.5.4

* Fix: When pressing Apply, the Caddy service will be reloaded instead of restarted. This fixes long restart times and service interruptions.
* Change: All Description Fields are now required to be populated.
* Change: Model Relation Fields now display two values instead of one to make most options appear unique.
* Add: HTTP response code and HTTP response message can be set per access list in advanced mode.
* Add: Header functionality added. Multiple header manipulations can be set per handler.
* Cleanup: Update searchBase() in ReverseProxyController.php for easier maintainability.
* Fix: Move selectpicker empty option to model in general.volt, using BlankDesc. This fixes the option IPv4+IPv6 not appearing in Dynamic DNS.
* Add: Simple Load Balancing support with the default random policy, by allowing to add multiple Upstream Domains in Handlers.
* Add: Passive Health check for load balancing (Upstream Fail Duration) in Handlers.
* Fix: Input validation so a base domain like "example.com" and a wildcard domain like "*.example.com" can now be created at the same time in domains.

1.5.3

* Change from "Phalcon Messages" to "OPNsense Messages" in Caddy.php.
* Change default storage location from /usr/local/etc/caddy to /var/db/caddy/data/caddy/.

* The RealInterfaceField custom Fieldtype was removed and replaced with an OPNsense integrated template function to read the interface name.
