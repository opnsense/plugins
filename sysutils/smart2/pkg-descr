The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd)
to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring, Analysis
and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most modern ATA and
SCSI hard disks.  It is derived from the smartsuite package, and includes
support for ATA/ATAPI/SATA disks and SCSI disks and tape devices.
