The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide
support for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies,
Power Distribution Units, Automatic Transfer Switch, Power Supply Units
and Solar Controllers.

NUT provides many control and monitoring features, with a uniform control
and management interface.
