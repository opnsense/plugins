Apcupsd, short for APC UPS daemon, can be used for controlling all APC UPS models.
It can monitor and log the current power and battery status, perform automatic
shutdown, and can run in network mode in order to power down other hosts on a LAN.

This plugin allows you to configure an APC UPS for use with OPNsense using the
Apcupsd project. The setup page allows you to set the most common options for
connecting your UPS to your OPNsense router and a status page for the UPS
status. It also includes support to act as an APC Netserver.
