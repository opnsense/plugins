The Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the open source
implementation of VMware Tools. They are a set of guest operating
system virtualization components that enhance performance and user
experience of virtual machines. As virtualization technology rapidly
becomes mainstream, each virtualization solution provider implements
their own set of tools and utilities to supplement the guest virtual
machine. However, most of the implementations are proprietary and
are tied to a specific virtualization platform.
