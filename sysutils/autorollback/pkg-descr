Automatic configuration rollback plugin for OPNsense.

Provides a "Safe Mode" that snapshots the current configuration before
changes are made. If the administrator does not confirm the changes within
a configurable timeout, the system automatically reverts to the previous
known-good configuration.

Features:

* Timer-based auto-revert with configurable timeout (default 120 seconds)
* Persistent countdown banner in the web UI for confirmation
* CLI confirmation via configctl for SSH users
* Always-on connectivity watchdog with configurable health checks
* Crash-safe: survives reboots via early boot recovery
* Dashboard widget showing real-time status
* Git backup integration (if os-git-backup is installed)
* Configurable rollback method: full reboot, service reload, or targeted restart

Inspired by Juniper JUNOS "commit confirmed" and MikroTik Safe Mode.
