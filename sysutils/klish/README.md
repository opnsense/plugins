# Klish Plugin

_The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on UNIX systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand Line Interface Shell. I know that "command" starts with "c" :)_

### One more shell?

After several years managing Security Operation Centers teams with an intense presence of unix-like OSes, I noted that even experienced analysts tend to commit common errors on the command line. Factors like fatigue, slight differences between shell flavors contribute to these common errors that result in time wasted, errors and other minor issues in every day managing command line tasks.

As an OPNsense enthusiast and heavy user, I believe the klish shell can make easy the tasks on the command line for network/system administrators that uses this wonderful network security platform.

The main purpose of this plugin is to help with a standardized commands which follow the WebGUI's Menus:

Initial commands structure:

-System: command `system`

-Interfaces: command `interfaces`

-Firewall: command `firewall`

-VPN: command `vpn`

-Services: command `services`

-Power: command `power`
